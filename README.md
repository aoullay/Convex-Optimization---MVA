# Convex-Optimization (MVA Course)

3rd Homework of the Convex Optimization Course (MVA)  : http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/OptConvexeM2.html

The goal of this homework was to implement the barrier method in order to solve a general quadratic problem with two different methods:       1. Damped Newton method 
  2. Backtracking line-search Newton method). 
  
These methods were then used to solve a Support Vector Machine Problem.
