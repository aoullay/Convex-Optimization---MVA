# Convex-Optimization (MVA Course)

3rd Homework of the Convex Optimization Course (MVA)  : http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/OptConvexeM2.html

The interior point algorithm uses the combination of self-concordant barrier and Newton
method to effciently solve many convex problems. 
In this homework, we focus on the general quadratic problem:

Two Newton methods were investigated to solve the Support Vector Machine Problem.
1. Damped Newton method <br />
  2. Backtracking line-search Newton method). <br />
